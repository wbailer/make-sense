# Annotation and configuration for few-shot object detection

This is a fork of [makesense.ai](https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense), with modifications to facilitate few-shot object detection with own datasets. The original make-sense readme with installation instructions can be found [here](README_make-sense.md).

At this point, this is still work in progress. A working version will be available in fall 2021.
